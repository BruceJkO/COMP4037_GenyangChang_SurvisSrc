        "abstract": "Dropout rate in Bangladeshi universities getting high day by day. Especially in engineering subjects. Massive number of students taking various engineering subjects for their under graduation. However, the completion rate is low. There can be mainly two types of reasons behind dropout- Academic or personal reasons. The target of this study is to find the factors behind the high dropout rate in Bangladeshi universities engineering subjects and also to detect risky profiles for dropout so that their dropout can be prevented. Current and previous student\u2019s data is analyzed to find the factors and students at the risk of dropout, which can be useful for developing new strategies in the education system by universities or other educational authorities. SVM, random forest, neural network, etc. were used for creating the prediction model.",

In this paper, we used educational data mining to predict students' final GPA based on their grades in previous courses. In our case study, we collected students' transcript data that included their final GPA and their grades in all courses. After pre-processing the data, we applied the J48 decision tree algorithm to discover classification rules. We extracted useful knowledge for final GPA, and identify the most important courses in the students' study plan based on their grades in the mandatory courses.",

        "abstract": "Educational data mining has received considerable attention in the last few years. Many data mining techniques are proposed to extract the hidden knowledge from educational data. The extracted knowledge helps the institutions to improve their teaching methods and learning process. All these improvements lead to enhance the performance of the students and the overall educational outputs. In this paper, we propose a new student\u2019s performance prediction model based on data mining techniques with new data attributes/features, which are called student\u2019s behavioral features. These type of features are related to the learner\u2019s interactivity with the e-learning management system. The performance of student\u2019s predictive model is evaluated by set of classifiers, namely; Artificial Neural Network, Na\u00efve Bayesian and Decision tree. In addition, we applied ensemble methods to improve the performance of these classifiers. We used Bagging, Boosting and Random Forest (RF), which are the common ensemble methods used in the literature. The obtained results reveal that there is a strong relationship between learner\u2019s behaviors and their academic achievement. The accuracy of the proposed model using behavioral features achieved up to 22.1% improvement comparing to the results when removing such features and it achieved up to 25.8% accuracy improvement using ensemble methods. By testing the model using newcomer students, the achieved accuracy is more than 80%. This result proves the reliability of the proposed model.",

        "abstract": "Context: School dropout is a significant challenge for the Brazilian education system. Several factors need to be corrected, and others eliminated so that students can to have access to higher education and guarantee the completion of their courses. Motivation: finding the best model to predict a specific problem is not a simple task. It's because the phenomena involved are not known, or are sophisticated modeling. Thus, combining models often produces better accuracy than individual models. Different models use this combination approach and have been applied in the context of Data Mining (MD), for prediction and classification. Objective: we propose in this study three different models to predict school dropout. These are based on Ensemble Regression. We apply the models in the context of the Brazilian Higher Education Institutions. Besides, it may help in the identification of the factors associated with dropout. For this, we used two techniques for the attribute selection: Stepwise and Pearson correlation. That techniques determine the factors related to dropout. Methodology: we used the data from the Census and Flow Indicators Higher Education. The methodology is based on CRISP-DM to understand, prepare, and model the data. We used predictive bagging methods to make a model to predict dropout. Results: the ensemble regression models proposed obtained better performance compared model literature. The ensemble model based on bagging of linear regression had a smaller prediction error. Besides, the models proposed in this study will help the educational administrators and policymakers working within the educational sector in the development of new policies that are relevant to student retention. But, the global implications of this research to practice is its ability to help in early identifying factories associated with students at risk of dropout of High Education.",

In the education field the research is developing rapidly increasing due to huge number of student\u2019s information which can be used to invent valuable pattern pertaining learning behavior of students. The institutions of education can utilize educational data mining to examine the performance of students which can support the institution in recognizing the student\u2019s performance. In data mining classification is a familiar technique that has been implemented widely to find the performance of students. In this study a new prediction algorithm for evaluating student\u2019s performance in academia has been developed based on both classification and clustering techniques and been ested on a real time basis with student dataset of various academic disciplines of higher educational institutions in Kerala, India. The result proves that the hybrid algorithm combining clustering and classification approaches yields results that are far superior in terms of achieving accuracy in prediction of academic performance of the students.",

        "abstract": "Predicting student academic performance has been an important research topic in Educational Data Mining (EDM) which uses machine learning and data mining techniques to explore data from educational settings. However measuring academic performance of students is challenging since students academic performance hinges on diverse factors. The interrelationship between variables and factors for predicting performance participate in complicated nonlinear ways. Traditional data mining and machine learning techniques may not be applied directly to these types of data and problems. In this study we develop a classification model to predict student performance using Deep Learning which automatically learns multiple levels of representation. We pre-train hidden layers of features layerwisely using an unsupervised learning algorithm sparse auto-encoder from unlabeled data, and then use supervised training for fine-tuning the parameters. We train model on a relatively large real world students dataset, and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method which can be applied into academic pre-warning mechanism.",

        "abstract": "An admissions system based on valid and reliable admissions criteria is very important to select candidates likely to perform well academically at institutions of higher education. This study focuses on ways to support universities in admissions decision making using data mining techniques to predict applicants\u2019 academic performance at university. A data set of 2,039 students enrolled in a Computer Science and Information College of a Saudi public university from 2016 to 2019 was used to validate the proposed methodology. The results demonstrate that applicants\u2019 early university performance can be predicted before admission based on certain pre-admission criteria (high school grade average, Scholastic Achievement Admission Test score, and General Aptitude Test score). The results also show that Scholastic Achievement Admission Test score is the pre-admission criterion that most accurately predicts future student performance. Therefore, this score should be assigned more weight in admissions systems. We also found that the Artificial Neural Network technique has an accuracy rate above 79%, making it superior to other classification techniques considered (Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Na\u00efve Bayes).",

Prediction models were developed using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree (DT) and Bayesian Networks (BNs). A large sample of 62,375 students was utilized in the procedures of model training and testing. The results of each model were presented in a confusion matrix and were analyzed by calculating the rates of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. The results suggested all of the three machine learning methods were effective for student dropout prediction, but DT presented a better performance.
